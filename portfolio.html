      <hr></hr>


      <p>In its infancy, motion.social was simply a web page with a collection of bike routes. The Co-Founders knew they wanted to target active people who are motivated by social connection over performance data, but exactly how that translated into a product was undecided.<br></br>
      Then I was brought on as a UX/UI Designer and first hire, and I immediately began conducting user interviews. I sat one-on-one with active people and asked them about their habits, goals, and frustrations. Through this I discovered that a common frustration was <i>planning</i> group activities. Long e-mail threads, inescapable group texts, and generic planning platforms were a pain to use. After examining the market, it was clear that many products focused on the <i>'during'</i> (tracking) and <i>'after'</i> (posting) part of an activity, but not the very beginning phase of getting a group of people together. Thus, with these findings, I designed a planning tool, with features more precisely targeted at socially and physically active users.</p>

      <hr></hr>

      <p>As an enthusiastic orienteer who loves introducing newcomers to the sport, I took on a complete redesign of the Cascade Orienteering Club web page. I did this as my capstone project for <a href="https://www.bloc.io/">BLOC</a>, an online bootcamp course, in lieu of a much simpler project for an imaginary company. I not only wanted real-world experience, but I wanted my work to mean something.
      <br></br>I began by interviewing users, from prospective participants to long-time veterans. My task was to design a page that would be welcoming to the former, yet efficent for the latter. With this in mind, I designed the front page to have a clear welcome mat for newcomers, which would direct them to friendly newcomer content, while creating one-click opportunities for veterans to register, get directions to the next event, and find the most recent results.<br></br>In addition to designing the site, I also wrote the Wordpress theme from scratch (PHP), in order to have complete control over the design.
      <br></br>The club still uses the template today, and the design is under consideration to be replicated for clubs across the country.</p>

      <p>I directed a complete rebranding and website redesign at MerGeo. While working with the Web Developer that we'd hired, I realized that I wanted to do more of his job than a client really should; and that's what lead me to become a UX Designer!<br></br><a href="http://nwtrailruns.com/" title="nwtrailruns.com">nwtrailruns.com</a><br></br><a href="http://streetscramble.com/" title="streetscramble.com">streetscramble.com</a><br></br><a href="http://navraces.com/" title="navraces.com">navraces.com</a></p>
