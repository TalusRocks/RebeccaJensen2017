        <h1>MerGeo</h1>
        
        <p>
          As Marketing Manager of a local running and adventure events company, I both oversaw and implemented all aspects of marketing. 
        </p>
        <p>
          My largest project was to rebrand MerGeo and its three entities (Northwest Trail Runs, Street Scramble, MerGeo Nav Races). Design challenges included:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Unifying the disconnected brands to enhance cross-promotion</li>
          <li>Modernizing the look to appeal to contemporary tastes</li>
          <li>Imbuing it all with a friendliness that would make athletic events feel approachable</li>
        </ul>
<br>
        <p>
          I accomplished a large part of this through a complete visual redesign. Drawing inspiration from outdoor brands, I used amiable hand drawn lines and bright colors that were slightly desaturated to have more affinity with nature than with screens. I implemented these designs in print, online, and on-site at our events.
        </p>

        <p>
          With very limited experience, I designed new website layouts that would be mobile-friendly, on-brand, and prominently feature important events while still providing quick access to what users wanted most. I started with sketches, then moved to Photoshop when I was ready to refine. While working with a Developer to build these designs, I found myself wanting to learn more and more about designing for the web, which is what began my journey to User Experience Design!

          After learning about UX, I discovered that I was already implementing some UX processes, and sought ways to apply it further. I had already been using quantitative data from e-mail campaigns, social media advertisements, and website visits to improve our click-through traffic and ultimately, registration numbers for events. UX inspired me to gather data beyond online clicks, so I surveyed our participants to learn more about their experience and identify how we could improve. This empowered me to make proposals not based just on a hunch, but on information gathered. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Eventually, I decided to take a bootcamp course on UX Design, and the rest of that journey can be found in this portfolio.

        <p>My designs persist today at:</p>
